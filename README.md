# mg-import-fix
Workaround fix for Japanese import issues for the migaku browser extension.
Most of this was coded fairly hastily and is a far from optimal solution, it runs fine and fairly quickly for small word counts however you may run into some performance issues with larger lists.
Feel free to use and modify this program as you see fit.

How to use:
1:  Install the custom backup anki add-on that can be found here:

    https://github.com/glutanimate/custom-text-backup
    
2:  Backup the deck(s) you wish to import into the browser extension (make sure to rename the files if importing multiple decks)

3.  Run the program in the directory containing your .txt files generated by the add-on
  
4.  Select which deck(s) and field (one per deck) you want to import
 
5.  Navigated to the restore from backup function within the migaku browser extension and pass over the .json file you have just generated using this program
  
6.  Success! You have successfully imported your deck(s)!
